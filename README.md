# Digital Clock - Kinetic

The idea for this project came from the CountToN project i did initially. if you look at that project, I'm displaying the number 0 to 9 using clock dials (kinetically using clock dials). So I thought what is the practical application of this counter application.
Hence, a digital clock.

## The project is live at:

## Had so much fun!!

This was a lot of fun. the project has simple css and html and uses plain javascript.
I got to play with css properties using javascript. It was not as complicated as the kinetic clock bubbles project but it sure does look awesome.

### The project is not a responsive web design

My main focus was to get the digital clock working, and i made it work. May be in future, i will think of doing a resposive web design, but for now, this is it!!
